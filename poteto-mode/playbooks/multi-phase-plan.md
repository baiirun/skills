### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** For work that spans phases or stacked PRs. The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. For a question about layout, timing, behavior, or whether an API works, run `playbooks/prototype.md`. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore through the active harness's delegation mechanism when available, using configured role models or the inherited parent model. Each worker returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. If delegation is unavailable, explore sequentially and keep the same compact outputs.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, use the repository's planning-doc directory or `.pstack/plans/`. Keep every heading and sub-block in order. One section per PR. Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**.
5. Write under `technical-writing` in full, then `unslop`. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Two rules apply verbatim. "i dont want any abstract metaphors" and "write like hemingway". Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Resolve the loaded `poteto-mode` skill directory through the active harness, then run `node <poteto-mode-skill-dir>/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` and fix every line it prints.
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and relevant performance boxes are checked. Build independent live lanes at the PR head using **swarm** when delegation is available; otherwise run them sequentially. Each lane names a concrete scenario, its evidence artifact, and its pass predicate. Size the lane count to the risk rather than fixing it to a model or number.

**Control capability.** Pick it by surface. Use the browser or application controller for web and desktop UIs, a terminal controller for CLIs and TUIs, and the available simulator driver for native mobile. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. Record a missing control capability as a verification risk.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `<poteto-mode-skill-dir>/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on her explicit go.
- [ ] On explicit go, persist this objective through the harness's goal or checkpoint mechanism. "<The plan path, the PR ids in order, the verification rule, who merges, and the done condition.>"
- [ ] Read these from trunk at program start. Re-read them at every tick.
  - [ ] Read `<poteto-mode-skill-dir>/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md` from the installed skill or the repository source when present.
  - [ ] Read the installed `swarm/SKILL.md`.
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:<control skill path>`
  - [ ] Read `<poteto-mode-skill-dir>/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`.
  - [ ] Read each other installed leaf skill the program uses.
- [ ] Arm a 30-minute audit tick through the active harness's recurring monitoring capability.
- [ ] At each tick, re-read the execution playbook and persisted objective. Audit drift, probe active lanes, replace stuck workers, and report material changes, gates, and blockers.
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, with `gh pr create` and `draft: false`, or with Graphite `gt` for a stack.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run a diff-cleanup pass before each commit and `no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every automated reviewer and security-reviewer comment per `../references/automated-review-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before babysit and again before the merge-ready report.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the merge-ready head SHA, run `swarm`. Include a gates lane, the risk-sized live lanes from **Verify, live**, the relevant performance lane, and one audit lane that checks the diff and receipts.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs in an isolated environment at the PR head. Use the surface-control capability available in the active harness.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmpswarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and relevant performance boxes are checked. Run the risk-sized lanes at the PR head per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 4. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 5. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 6. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 7. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 8. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on a lane VM. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] automated reviewer triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends the PR to the Graphite stack and the operator lands it.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
- [ ] Reply to the operator with the report the execution playbook names.

## Appendix A. Prototype evidence

<Each open question a prototype answered, with the branch, the SHA, and the artifact links. Each question that stays unproven.>

## Appendix B. Alternatives rejected

<Each approach weighed and why it lost.>

## Appendix C. Risks

<Each risk with the PR it lands in and what the owner watches.>

## Appendix D. Links and reading list

<Docs and installed skills to read before editing. Name which PRs use `interrogate` and `show-me-your-work`.>
